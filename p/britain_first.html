          <h1>Britain First: a showcase of idiocy</h1>
          <p>If you live outside of the UK, you may not have seen this, but there's this Facebook group called Britain First. They're an offshoot of the BNP, who are a bunch of fascist lunatics (or more the press arm of the BNP) who hate people who aren't white. I've always found anyone against immigration a laughing stock: the UK is an island nation; the only way people could have started living here is because they emigrated. It's pretty dumb to stop something so crucial to society.</p>
          <p>Moving back on topic, I wanted to pick apart a few things I noticed from this bunch of merry idiots.</p>
          <h2>Bhurkas v. Balaclavas</h2>
          <img class="c" src="http://i.imgur.com/QqA3ovp.png">
          <p>In this "lovely" photo, it ponders this question: <b>are bhurkas and balaclavas the same?</b> No, even from a security standpoint. If someone wears a balaclava, chances are they're going to commit a crime, and that's quite fair to say: they are designed to conceal most of the face to make you unrecognisable. Bhurkas, on the other aren't. Also, bhurkas are almost permenant headgear, as opposed to balaclavas, which are only really worn in times where you don't want to be identifiable.</p>
          <h2>Cats and Hypocracies</h2>
          <img class="c" src="http://i.imgur.com/tPH9DQW.png">
          <p>Also, I found this picture. So, apparently, before the election, the politicians make themselves look cute (or Photoshopped, which can be said for the current PM), before staring at you angrily, as if it's your fault they're in politics. What makes this picture better in my opinion is the fact that BF identifies (or wants to identify) as a political party seperate from the BNP.</p>
          <p>That's all I noticed for now. I might write more later.</p>
